# Introduction

This private project is a migration version of a company employee and order management application that I wrote for my company before. The company application was built in JAVA and is now rebuilt in NET CORE. The features that I have completed so far are employee view and add, order view and add. If I have time I will continue to improve the functionality of this project.



# How to use
1. Development.json file to match your own database, I'm using Sql Server.
2. I have written seed data for the test application. If you don't want to use it, remember to uncomment it in the program.cs file.
3. Just run dotnet watch run.

# TODO
- [ ] I'm trying to write unit tests to refine the iterations of the feature, and I don't have a clue for now.
- [ ] Add employee login function and assign different departmental privileges.
